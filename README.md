CDN stands for content delivery network. It's a system of servers that deliver web content to users based on their location. CDNs are used to speed up the loading of web pages, especially for sites with a lot of data. 
How it works 
CDNs store copies of web content in data centers around the world.
When a user visits a website, the CDN finds the closest server with the requested content.
The content is then delivered to the user's device from that server.
Benefits
CDNs can improve website performance and reduce page load times. 
CDNs can help protect websites from malicious attacks, such as DDoS attacks. 
CDNs can provide TLS/SSL certificates, which encrypt data and ensure a high standard of authentication. 
Examples
Google Cloud CDN uses Google's global edge network to deliver content to users. 
Many major sites, including Facebook, Netflix, and Amazon, use CDNs.
